Certainly! Below is a detailed breakdown for each of the three pages—**Login**, **Super Admin**, and **Sub Admin**—covering their current status, pending changes, integration requirements with the BloodLink APIs, and overall implementation strategy.

---

### **Login Page**

The Login page serves as the primary entry point for all users of the BloodLink system, including administrators, sub-admins, and potentially other user roles in future expansions. At present, this page has been built using a minimalistic and functional layout with basic input fields for username/email and password. However, the page is not yet fully equipped to handle the complete authentication flow required for seamless integration with the BloodLink API.

Pending work includes the implementation of form validation (both client-side and server-side), secure handling of user credentials, and API call integration to authenticate the user. The API endpoint responsible for login requires specific parameters such as `email/username`, `password`, and possibly a `role` identifier to distinguish between different types of users. The frontend must also be modified to correctly capture these fields and construct the appropriate payload for the API request.

Additionally, the login flow needs to be enhanced with proper feedback mechanisms for invalid credentials, network failures, and server-side errors. Upon successful login, the user should receive and store a secure session token or JWT (JSON Web Token), which will be used for subsequent API calls to ensure authenticated access. Routing logic must also be implemented to redirect users to the correct dashboard (Super Admin or Sub Admin) based on their assigned role after authentication is complete. Security aspects such as HTTPS enforcement, input sanitization, and password encryption (handled via backend) also need to be considered during final integration.

### **Super Admin Page**

The Super Admin page is designed for users with the highest level of access privileges within the BloodLink platform. These users are responsible for overseeing the entire blood management system, managing user roles, monitoring donor activity, and controlling access permissions. While the initial layout of the Super Admin page has been drafted using a straightforward and easily extendable structure, it is not yet fully functional and requires significant integration with the backend APIs.

One of the key responsibilities of the Super Admin is managing sub-admins and overseeing system-wide activities. To support these tasks, the page must include modules such as:

* **View and manage all registered users** (sub-admins, hospitals, etc.)
* **Monitor blood inventory levels across locations**
* **Approve or revoke access rights**
* **Generate and view system-wide reports**

Each of these modules will rely heavily on specific API endpoints, and the current draft lacks full support for sending and receiving the necessary parameters such as user IDs, access tokens, role designations, filtering criteria, and pagination details.

Moreover, the user interface needs enhancements to support data visualization (e.g., charts, status indicators), interactive tables with sorting and filtering capabilities, and action buttons tied to backend operations like user suspension, report generation, and role reassignment. Error handling, loading states, and confirmation modals also need to be implemented for a complete user experience.

Another important area of development is access control. The Super Admin dashboard should restrict access to certain features based on the user’s authentication level, ensuring only verified Super Admins can perform high-level actions. All of these functionalities are pending and will be added in upcoming development cycles as the BloodLink APIs are fully mapped and finalized.

### **Sub Admin Page**

The Sub Admin page caters to users who operate under the supervision of the Super Admin and typically manage specific regions, hospitals, or blood bank branches. The initial draft of the Sub Admin page follows a simplistic UI framework, designed to be easy to extend once backend API structures and parameters are finalized. However, it remains incomplete and currently lacks key features needed for it to be operational within the broader BloodLink ecosystem.

Key functionalities expected on the Sub Admin page include:

* **Managing donor information** (add, update, delete records)
* **Tracking blood unit inventory** for their assigned location
* **Scheduling and updating blood donation events**
* **Communicating with donors via alerts or messages**
* **Viewing region-specific reports and statistics**

To implement these features, several API integrations are required. These include endpoints for CRUD operations on donor profiles, blood inventory status checks, event creation/update APIs, and data retrieval endpoints for reports. Each API call will demand certain parameters such as Sub Admin ID, region ID, donor ID, blood group, and timestamps—all of which need to be correctly captured and passed from the frontend.

The current version of the page does not yet handle these dynamic API interactions and lacks form validation, session-based access control, and response-based conditional rendering (e.g., showing different content depending on the data returned by the APIs). Furthermore, UI components like data tables, form modals, and event calendars are placeholders for now and require functional logic tied to the backend services.

Another crucial aspect yet to be developed is error feedback and session management. Sub Admins must be prevented from accessing Super Admin features, and their access should be automatically revoked upon token expiry or logout. These mechanisms are pending and will be implemented after finalizing API documentation and parameter structures.
